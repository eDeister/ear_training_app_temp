# Earworm

[Earworm is an ear-training webapp designed to hand control over to the user. Unlike other webapps of the
same purpose, Earworm lets the user create and save melodies to pick out the differences between them.
We also let the user pick which virtual instrument they want to be tested on - often times if a musician
only trains their ears on a single instrument, their training is only useful for that one instrument.]
