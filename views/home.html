              <h2>Our Mission</h2>
              <p>
                  Earworm is an ear-training webapp designed to hand control over to the user. Unlike other webapps of the
                  same purpose, Earworm lets the user create and save melodies to pick out the differences between them.
                  We also let the user pick which virtual instrument they want to be tested on - often times if a musician
                  only trains their ears on a single instrument, their training is only useful for that one instrument.

              <h2>About us</h2>
              <p>
                  We are a team of two software developers currently studying for a Bachelor's degree.<br>

                  Ethan first started coding in his sophomore year in high school with a couple of java classes and has been
                  hooked ever since. While he had always been interested in music, he took a much greater interest in piano
                  at the start of 2021. When he started searching for a way to improve his perfect pitch, he was
                  disappointed by the limited number of options at his disposal.<br>
